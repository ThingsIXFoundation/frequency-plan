# Frequency Plans

This repository contains the frequency-plan definitions for the ThingsIX network (in other words, what frequencies are used in what area of the world). The ThingsIX network doesn't stop at the coast line. We have multiple use-cases on sea too. Therefore not only the boundaries of a country on land are used, but also the EEZ (Economic Eclusive Zones) are included. 

Currently only EU868 is enabled.
